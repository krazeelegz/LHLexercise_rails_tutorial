# Lighthouse Forum

Welcome to our introduction to Rails!

We're going to build a simple open forum app that allows users to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**estroy posts. Those words should sound familiar. CRUD is a central tenet to building relational database-backed applications (the kind Rails is great at!), so this tutorial should provide some great building blocks to use in the web apps you'll be building for the next few weeks and months and years. Very exciting.

As you've probably noticed, this tutorial is divided into handy commits for not only organization, but also to give you a reference as you work.

## 1. rails new [★](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/lighthouse_forum/commit/e1390feced2e0d965da1e86c80fe9add4a0ab051)

To create a Rails app, your job couldn't be any easier. From the console for this app, type `rails new lighthouse_forum`. `cd` into the directory, open it with your editor of choice, and behold the ~~magic of Rai~~ WHOA that's a ton of files.

Here's a nice rundown of all of these files, but we'll walk through the ones you'll need for this tutorial as we go.

Before we commit, it's a good idea to find your `README.rdoc` that's auto-generated by Rails and replace it with the more common `README.md`. You know what this is for. Feel free to edit as you wish.

## 2. routing /posts to /posts/index.html.erb [★](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/lighthouse_forum/commit/e7165e9c0d49d8add2b177685e8f7126a0f00b16)

Believe it or not at this point, we can already display a page. In the console, type `rails server`, and you'll see the line `Rails [X.X.X] application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000` (among others). This means—you guessed it—you can visit 0.0.0.0:3000 or localhost:3000 in your browser and see the "Welcome aboard" default Rails page. Success!

For this app, we'll need a page that displays all posts. The typical URL structure for such a page is [root]/posts, so let's try to get localhost:3000/posts to display a list of posts. (We don't have them yet, but we will very soon.)

If you visit localhost:3000/posts now, you'll see an error saying "No route matches `[GET] "/posts"`". This implies we sent a GET request to "/posts", but Rails wasn't sure what we were trying to do. Let's help it.

Find your `config/routes.rb` and add this code:

    LighthouseForum::Application.routes.draw do

      get 'posts', to: 'posts#index'

      # [tons of helpful comments]
    end

As you can get, this is where Rails' routing is handled. Now when we visit localhost:3000/posts, we see Rails has successfully routed the request. It recognized the request to `posts` as a GET request.

But now we have another error: "uninitialized constant PostsController". Let's fix this by putting said PostsController in the correct spot. From the console, `touch app/controllers/posts_controller.rb`, and write the following code:

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      
    end

As you know from your experience with Ruby, we've now made a new class `PostsController` that inherits from `ApplicationController`. (If you check out `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`, you'll notice it inherits from `ActionController::Base` which is where the real magic is coming from.)
