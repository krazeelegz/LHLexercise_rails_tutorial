# Lighthouse Forum

Welcome to our introduction to Rails!

We're going to build a simple open forum app that allows users to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**estroy posts. Those words should sound familiar. CRUD is a central tenet to building relational database-backed applications (the kind Rails is great at!), so this tutorial should provide some great building blocks to use in the web apps you'll be building for the next few weeks and months and years. Very exciting.

As you've probably noticed, this tutorial is divided into handy commits for not only organization, but also to give you a reference as you work.

To create a Rails app, your job couldn't be any easier. From the console for this app, type `rails new lighthouse_forum`. `cd` into the directory, open it with your editor of choice, and behold the ~~magic of Rai~~ WHOA that's a ton of files.

Here's a nice rundown of all of these files, but we'll walk through the ones you'll need for this tutorial as we go.

Before we commit, it's a good idea to find your `README.rdoc` that's auto-generated by Rails and replace it with the more common `README.md`. You know what this is for. Feel free to edit as you wish.
